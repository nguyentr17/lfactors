#' @title Lfactors
#'
#' @description \code{lfactor} creates a factor that can be compared to its levels or labels.
#'
#' @param x a vector of data, in numeric format.
#' @param levels a vector of levels in x. Unlike factor, these must be numeric. 
#' @param labels a vector of labels for the levels. This vector must be either
#'               characters that cannot be cast as numeric or characters that are
#'               equal to the level when cast as numeric.
#' @param \dots arguments passed to \code{\link[base]{factor}}.
#'
#' @details 
#' An lfactor can be compared to the levels or the labels (see the `Examples'). Because of that,
#' the levels must be numeric and the labels must be either not castable as numeric or equal to
#' the levels when cast as numeric.
#' 
#' An lfactor is, essentialy, a factor that remembers the levels as well as the labels argument.
#' Note that all of the arguments are passed to \code{\link[base]{factor}}. Because lfactor imposes
#' some additional constraints on the types of levels and labels and stores additional information,
#' an lfactor both uses more memory than and is, in some ways, more limited than a factor.
#' 
#' @return
#' An object of class lfactor that also implement \code{\link[base]{factor}}
